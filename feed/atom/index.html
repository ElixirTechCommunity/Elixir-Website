					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.gocloudforce.com/a-gold-standard-making-microsoft-work-for-you/"><![CDATA[<p>As an experienced Microsoft Partner, Cloudforce has learned and earned its way into a position that allows us to make the nearly $200 billion dollar company that is Microsoft work for <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>In today’s world there is a scramble for technical solutions to accommodate modern work, security needs, infrastructure logistics, and more. With each scramble comes a solution, but it seems not many know what they are or how to get them.</p>
<p>If you are a company in today’s post-pandemic modern era, how easy is it for you to not only adopt the technical solutions necessary, but gain the know-how to utilize them yourself?</p>
<p>We have deciphered and utilized the full arsenal of Microsoft’s VAST well of knowledge, programs, and yes, even incentives for clients to adapt and grow using Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>Partaking in the many (understatement of the year) resources available to partners, which included attending Microsoft Inspire 2022, Cloudforce has really gone to work in understanding Microsoft’s programs and opportunities for our customers to adapt and adopt. (You may have seen this in our blog series for the past few months, where we asked several team members to write a post on a topic relating to Inspire and the various updates Microsoft released with it.)</p>
<p>A great example of our dedication was with a client whose IT team was in need of training on Microsoft Teams, as they were considering it for their communications solution. Microsoft has provided a partner-led training program that only a few partners know about yet alone are qualified to deliver.</p>
<p>Did you know that <strong><em>only</em></strong> Partners with an exclusive “Solutions Partner” designation have an exclusive right to deliver these customizable workshops to that end?</p>
<p>Cloudforce does.</p>
<p>And with that knowledge, Cloudforce delivered this workshop to train this client in not only the exact Teams solutions they needed, but more importantly, how to implement them. The best part is this client paid nothing for it.</p>
<p>Making Microsoft work for you is the reason why we have attained the new Solutions Partner designations with Microsoft in the areas of Azure Infrastructure and Modernized Apps. We have also achieved what is called Advanced Specialization — a specialization only a small percentage of partners are able to reach. These standards require benchmarks for a partner’s expertise, skill, and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>We passed those benchmarks because we have made it a priority to have our company not only meet these standards, but to pass on the benefits to you.</p>
<p>Now of course, there isn’t enough time here to go over everything we know — which just gets updated at a blinding pace anyway. Instead, you can take a look at our blog series to find insights on Microsoft updates and how we make them work for you. Whether you are a partner of ours or looking to make the move to Azure (or if you want to transition from not understanding how various Microsoft programs and products work, to making them work for <em>you)</em>, please shoot me a message on LinkedIn — I’d be more than happy to help.</p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.gocloudforce.com/can-cutting-carbon-help-businesses-cut-costs-a-move-to-the-cloud-and-a-more-sustainable-future/"><![CDATA[<p><span data-contrast="auto">Microsoft Inspire 2022 explored the company’s dedication to cutting carbon emissions – and challenged the notion that sustainability and efficiency are mutually exclusive. Microsoft’s growth and expansion is matched with a concerted effort to curtail emissions and advance a culture that is kind to both people and planet. Microsoft knows that actively expanding requires a constant and vigilant focus on emissions and carbon pollution – their 20% growth this year (propelled by both physical expansion into new data centers as well as their booming gaming business) also means combating greater emissions. But is this pursuit of cutting carbon detrimental to larger business goals, efficiency, and profitability? </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Microsoft President and Vice Chair Brad Smith portended the urgency of the current environmental crisis and presented a call to action: “Humanity emits 52 gigatons of greenhouse gases every year, and we’ve got to get that down to what we call net-zero by the middle of the century.” The fight begins with transparency – Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability empowers businesses with the data to actually measure their environmental footprint. Measurement is essential, Smith urges, because “If you don’t measure it, everybody will feel good. They’ll say, ‘I’m working so hard, I must be doing good work,’ and it may not add up to anything more than sort of a false delusion.” Measurements can thus inform the creation of carbon targets across a company. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Empowering Microsoft’s work is no shortage of support and enthusiasm – people who work with and around them, directly and indirectly, are actively engaged and passionate about their efforts. The drive to protect the environment is not a solo effort – and the charge falls to every business, as well as to every individual.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Businesses may ask, then, if their drive to support net-zero emissions would necessitate monetary losses. Microsoft CVP of Sustainability Elizabeth Brinton quelled anxieties about having to pick either sustainability or profitability: “It’s not an either/or, are we going to grow, or are we going to do the right thing for people and planet?” Leveraging the Microsoft cloud to increase your organization’s efficiency can mean an increase in sustainability – your organization runs faster, and thus produces less carbon. Elizabeth offered the example of manufacturing – using Azure Internet of Things (IoT) and advanced analytics can help a manufacturing process become more efficient, and therefore less wasteful environmentally and economically. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A move to the Microsoft cloud in the pursuit of sustainable infrastructure is two-fold: one, a move to the cloud fuels business productivity, as <a href="https://www.wsp.com/en-US/insights/microsoft-cloud-computing-environmental-benefit-study">a 2018 Microsoft and WSP USA study</a> reminds us that “c</span><span data-contrast="auto">ommercial cloud services can operate with greater efficiency than smaller, on-premises deployments</span> <span data-contrast="auto">thanks to large-scale dynamic provisioning and multitenancy, which allow for more efficient use of IT resources.” This heightened business efficiency with a migration from slow, costly on-premises infrastructure to the cloud cuts both costs and carbon — opting for a faster cloud solution wastes less energy. Indeed, the</span><span data-contrast="auto"> “Microsoft cloud is up to </span><span data-contrast="auto">93 percent more energy-efficient and can result in 98 percent lower carbon emissions than traditional enterprise data centers.” Thus, operational and environmental efficiency are linked, and the Microsoft cloud offers both. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cloudforce is driven by the mission that technology should make lives easier – this includes making work and businesses more efficient. Efficiency can encourage sustainability – wasting less energy by achieving faster, more immediate solutions can help support environmental goals.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.gocloudforce.com/new-opportunities-for-organizational-growth-with-azure-virtual-desktop/"><![CDATA[<h3><span data-contrast="auto">What is Azure Virtual Desktop?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) – initially coined Windows Virtual Desktop – launched in September of 2019. AVD allows for a fully managed desktop virtualization solution in Microsoft Azure. But what does this mean exactly? </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">AVD enables users to virtualize their desktop (which consists of user data, applications, and the operating system) and position these systems in the cloud. What you’re left with is a full desktop experience that is accessible from almost any device, in addition to the peace of mind that company data is not free flowing on end-user devices. This data stays in the cloud and remains separate from user hardware which is susceptible to being lost or stolen. Additionally, this enables IT departments to centrally manage the user environment and ensure compliance. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">AVD distinguishes itself from other virtual desktop solutions of the past in that it is a fully managed offering in the cloud. This allows for scalability, load balancing, and the easy configuration of user profiles within Microsoft Azure. Further climbing down the rabbit hole: administrators can configure multi-session capabilities in host pools to drastically reduce cost by having multiple users per virtual machine – all running Windows 10 or 11. This reduces the complexity of managing larger environments.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With the recent push and demand to migrate to a hybrid workplace, virtual desktop solutions have become even more sought out. Organizations are experiencing a need to onboard and offboard employees at a rapid rate, some of which have rotating employees across the globe. Not only that, but these employees may need varying levels of performance to accommodate their workload. AVD offers a secure, scalable, and cost-effective solution for these companies to equip their staff with Windows 10 and 11 desktops that are fit to their needs – at lightning speed – no matter where they are.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Microsoft has taken AVD to the next level by constantly updating and making the virtual desktop experience even closer to the on-premises experience. At Microsoft Inspire 2022, Kam Vedbrat, the Director for AVD at Microsoft, presented some of the newest updates that have enhanced the AVD experience. He mentioned, “The scenarios we hear about from our customers and partners drive all the new features and updates we release.” Some of the new features include:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We’ve experienced the benefits of these updates firsthand at Cloudforce. Most notably, the enhanced capabilities of Microsoft Teams have been a breakthrough for creating solutions with AVD. Many of our clients that use Microsoft Teams as their collaboration platform naturally want to extend that capability to their AVD users. Previously the full set of features Teams&#8217; users were used to on a local machine weren&#8217;t available for the media-optimized version. This had been a small but very limiting reality for AVD users when virtual collaboration was essential for those remote users. This past spring, Microsoft updated the media-optimized version of Teams to include key features such as background effects, multi-windowed clients, live captions, and give-and-take control features.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">New features like the ones mentioned are fundamental to many organizations’ workflows. Now equipped with these features, we at Cloudforce can be even more confident in the solutions we’re creating for organizations, and likewise, organizations can be confident in the quality of the solutions we’re delivering.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Recently, the increased demand that we’ve seen for a reliable virtual desktop experience has motivated us at Cloudforce to pursue the Microsoft Windows Virtual Desktop Advanced Specialization, which we hope will soon be in our hands. This will enable us to bring this solution to more and more organizations, unlocking new business potential, and creating lasting partnerships. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.gocloudforce.com/microsoft-simplifies-organizational-alignment-with-release-of-vivas-okr-module/"><![CDATA[<p>Ubiquitous to any organizational theory or model is the aspiration to motivate and direct a collection of individuals to achieve a shared goal. Simply stated, how can leadership point the boat in the right direction and get the crew to row together?</p>
<p>One of the better-known responses to this question is encapsulated in John Doerr’s 2018 book <em>Measure What Matters</em>,¹ the seminal work on the subject of OKRs, that is, Objectives and Key Results. OKRs were conceived by Andy Grove at Intel around 1975 and, later, evangelized and implemented by Sergey Brin and Larry Page, the co-founders of Google.</p>
<p>According to Doerr, OKRs are “a collaborative goal-setting methodology used by teams and individuals to set challenging, ambitious goals with measurable results. OKRs are how you track progress, create alignment, and encourage engagement around measurable goals.”² OKRs are expressed in the following formula: “I will (Objective) as measured by (Key Results). For example, ‘I will fix the website for the vast majority of people as measured by 7 out of 10 people being able to get through, a 1 second response time, and a 1% error rate.’”³</p>
<p>From these humble origins, OKRs have become the marching cry for thousands of startups to enterprise-scale corporations seeking alignment for their team’s collective efforts.</p>
<p>Since gaining familiarity with the OKR model through a teamwide reading of <em>Measure What Matters</em>, Cloudforce, with advanced specialization in Windows Server and SQL Server migrations, has enthusiastically adopted this goal-setting methodology. The impact of this decision is clearly evident in the hypergrowth of both our team as well as the portfolio of valued clients we serve.</p>
<p>One of the crucial tenants to the OKR paradigm is its public visibility across the enterprise,<sup>4</sup> a functionality that Cloudforce has previously achieved through a third-party SaaS solution, <a href="https://www.paycor.com/7geese/">7Geese (now a Paycor company)</a>. For this reason, a collective cheer arose at Cloudforce during <a href="https://inspire.microsoft.com/en-US/home">this year’s Microsoft Inspire keynote</a> when CEO Satya Nadella announced the pending arrival of Viva Goals, Microsoft’s native solution to OKR creation and tracking, as part of the Microsoft Viva Suite. (Viva is Microsoft’s budding “employee experience platform that brings together communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights in the flow of work.”<sup>5</sup>)</p>
<p>Digging deeper during a breakout session entitled “Enable Digital Employee Experience with Microsoft Viva,” Seth Patton, General Manager for Microsoft 365 and Viva product marketing, highlighted Viva Goals’s ability to align disparate teams to an organization’s strategic priorities. It does so by enabling executives to create clarity and alignment so that everyone in the company can confidently work towards the correct priorities. Equally important is the way in which Viva Goals allows individuals to remain squarely in the flow of work through its direct integration with Microsoft Teams. With Viva Goals, OKRs will no longer need to exist in a silo or, in Cloudforce’s case, a third-party solution.</p>
<p>Currently, Viva Goals can be procured as part of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-viva/pricing?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab">Microsoft Viva Suite</a> for $9.00 user/month (with an auto-renewing annual subscription).</p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.gocloudforce.com/professional-development-opportunities-for-non-technologists/"><![CDATA[<p><span data-contrast="auto">This past quarter, Cloudforce held a company-wide challenge to encourage growth and learning (with a side of friendly competition). Certification opportunities were on display in the office and the technology team was incentivized to be the first to pass the exam. It was fun to observe and impressive to watch the team seemingly effortlessly obtain these certs.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">But what about the other side of the house – us non-technologists? Watching our technology counterparts gobble up certifications with Pacman-like speed piqued our motivation to find similar opportunities appropriate to our roles in operations and management.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Thankfully, Microsoft has made it possible for us to experience some of that satisfaction for ourselves. With a ton of learning paths, training, and certifications available to all, Microsoft’s </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/browse/"><span data-contrast="none">course catalog</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> ensures everyone &#8211; even the less technical among us &#8211; has plenty of opportunities to take part. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Here are three Microsoft professional learning opportunities for non-technical team members:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Microsoft Viva</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Microsoft’s employee experience platform, </span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-viva?rtc=1#office-GuidedTour-ibzdoo8"><span data-contrast="none">Viva</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, seeks to support employee productivity and well-being through direct daily engagement. Using AI, Viva learns employee work habits and provides insights as to how you can make your workday more efficient. Viva&#8217;s encouragement of positive mental health practices like meditation is especially timely, given that </span><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/relaxation-benefits-meditation-stronger-relaxation-benefits-taking-vacation-2016102710532"><span data-contrast="none">meditation</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> can be more beneficial than a vacation. And with Teams as its hub, you can seamlessly integrate Viva into your daily routine, becoming more efficient over time. Lastly, Viva offers a Teams Insights feature for managers and leaders, providing data-driven revelations into employee engagement and satisfaction. Creating a culture of health and well-being is in vogue right now, but for good reason &#8211; when people feel cared for by their managers, they’re </span><a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/215924/well-being.aspx"><span data-contrast="none">happier and more productive</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Everyone wins. Check out Microsoft&#8217;s Viva documentation and walk through the </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/workplace-analytics-ways-working-action/"><span data-contrast="none">available learning modules</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to learn more.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">365 Fundamentals</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It might be tempting to take a solution like 365 for granted. But within this software that we use daily, there is plenty of complexity. Know the difference between Office 365 and Microsoft 365? Going far beyond the scope of Word and Excel, 365 Fundamentals offers insights from the lens of an administrator (versus a user). </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/microsoft-365-fundamentals/?WT.mc_id=M365_BoM-wwl%3FWT.mc_id%3DM365_BoM-wwl"><span data-contrast="none">Learn</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> about cloud concepts, security, and data analytics and how they all tie together under the umbrella of 365. A </span><a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE3VwVw"><span data-contrast="none">certification exam</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is also on the table for this learning path, and since this is one the engineering team may not have at the top of their list, you could position yourself as the resident expert on some of these topics.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Azure Fundamentals</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While this one definitely straddles the line between technical and not, the Azure Fundamentals learning path offered by Microsoft is approachable even for a tech newbie. These modules go just granular enough to provide you a big-picture understanding of Microsoft Azure, its core offerings, and beginner-level insights into the beneficial solutions your teams are working with. Azure Fundamentals allows you to dip a toe (okay, more like both feet, ankle-deep) into the waters of what can be done within Azure. This learning path also has the potential for a </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-900"><span data-contrast="none">certification</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> (bonus!). As a bona fide non-technologist who recently passed this exam, be assured – if I can, you can. Microsoft provides plenty of options for learning this content – go at your own pace through various </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/23110622/collections/0kjyh8rn5x76j6"><span data-contrast="none">learning modules</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, attend a (free!) Azure Fundamentals</span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/training-days/azure/fundamentals"><span data-contrast="none"> training day</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, or take an</span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/az-900t00"><span data-contrast="none"> instructor-led training sessio</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">n. Learning this content is a fun feather in your cap; who knows, maybe you’ll join the tech team after all.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As the saying goes, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Any one of these professional development opportunities will better equip you to come alongside your technical team with confidence while deepening your Microsoft solution knowledge base. Company cert challenges beware! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}">If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about the opportunities above, please contact us via the links below! </span></p>

Availability, cost effectiveness, and security are three top reasons companies will eventually migrate to Azure. Usually, the first step in many organizations’ cloud adoption is to lift and shift current virtual machines into Azure. While being effective at providing some of the advantages that the cloud has to offer, without intense configuration, things like cost effectiveness and scalability can seem unattainable to even the most seasoned IT personnel. With the inclusion of Azure App Service discovery, assessments, and migration tools, Microsoft has enabled organizations to cut the line in their journey to the cloud, while taking full advantage of the scalability, cost, and agility that Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) is known for.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.gocloudforce.com/unlock-your-organizations-potential-with-microsoft-marketplace/"><![CDATA[<p><span data-contrast="auto">In today’s business world, it’s no secret that the role of IT has expanded. I’m not just talking about the growth of a department, but a total change in how much businesses rely on IT. Many would argue that IT has become the business, and from my perspective as Head of Partnerships at Cloudforce, I would agree. With the digital transformation we’ve seen over the last 10 years, that isn’t likely to change anytime soon. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The need for cloud services is at an all-time high and is projected to double yearly over the next couple of years. Looking back to 2018, cloud services spend was around $200 billion. In 2022, it is anticipated to reach over $500 billion, and in 2025, analysts predict cloud services spending to eclipse $1.3 trillion.¹</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With that level of demand for cloud services, one might ask how cloud services can be scaled to meet it. One way is through marketplaces, such as Microsoft Marketplace. Microsoft Marketplace is home to over 15,000 sellers and over 90,000 partners. Technology sellers and partners have been working hard to expand their offerings and make them readily available for the one billion customers shopping for these services. Why wouldn’t you want your products or services in the marketplace, especially when there are over 15,000 sellers that could be selling your product or service on your behalf? That’s a large salesforce that you don’t have to pay for! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It is anticipated that in three years, nearly 80% of all cloud services sales transactions will be through digital channels,²</span><span data-contrast="auto"> such as Microsoft Marketplace. This shift is going to reduce the number of person-to-person interactions we’ve become accustomed to over the years, so companies that are relying on traditional sales methods are going to be left behind. Heck, even Microsoft is getting into the rewards game, just like grocery stores and department stores. Microsoft rolled out Marketplace Rewards to incentivize its customers to purchase services through Marketplace in exchange for Azure consumption credits. Another way Microsoft is making this vehicle more attractive to vendors is by dropping agency fees considerably. The industry standard agency fee was nearly 20%, but Microsoft lowered their fee to only 3%, knowing that the shift to digital transactions was coming and swiftly/instantly made themselves much more attractive to prospective vendors looking for a home for their products and services. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-1871 alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Free-Assessment-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Free-Assessment-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Free-Assessment-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Free-Assessment-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Free-Assessment.jpg 1298w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></span><span data-contrast="auto">Over the years, IT buying and selling has traditionally been done though referrals and personal relationships. IT buyers buy from people they’ve worked with and trust. This new way of digital transactions couldn’t be further from that relationship-selling model and stands to be tested. Will it last, only time will tell. One thing is for sure, if you’ve got products or services and aren’t in one or more of the various marketplaces, you could very well miss out on a lot of good opportunities coming down the road and be left behind.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cloudforce has seen firsthand the value of having offers in the Azure Marketplace.

<p><span data-contrast="none">So began the Microsoft Inspire conference this past July on the urgent need to meet the needs of today’s hybrid digital workforce. Today, it’s a seller’s market for expert tech workers looking to land full-time employment with hybrid work modality. For employers, this means offering accessible and engaging work platforms that can also be robustly secured across multiple, disparate worker locations to mitigate risk. Luckily, Microsoft is ready to deliver.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Just as great health benefits, work-life balance enhancements, education supplements, and retirement savings options once defined top job prerequisites, today’s job seekers have upped the ante with demands for jobs that offer engagement, relevance, and collaboration options right from the comfort of their home office. And just in time, Microsoft Gold Partner, Cloudforce, is pleased to highlight a few of the latest introductions and developments in this incredible new arsenal of secure, digital remote work goodies:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

The Great Resignation (just in case you needed another cliché) has taught enough organizations in all sectors and geographies that the cost of ignoring these changes is high enough that every operations executive and HR decision maker ought to have one (or three) of these phrases firmly burned into their decision-making consciousness. Or at the very least, printed out and affixed to their workspace, whatever gets the message through. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While these statements accurately illustrate where we are, they don’t offer much in the way of proactive strategy. For that, we can turn to another key Inspire 2022 term </span><span data-contrast="none">–</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the “Digital Imperative”. Essentially, it is no longer enough to offer novel integrations of technology and process to achieve solutions for institutions as a matter of differentiation </span><span data-contrast="none">–</span><span data-contrast="auto"> organizations need to treat this as a matter of survival. Unless you can proactively demonstrate you are actively innovating how work gets done and objectives are achieved, you will be left behind. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It&#8217;s easy to see the impact this can have externally, to you and your customers (or even vendors). It is easy, then, to overlook the same call to action this offers internally: you must be taking steps to meet your </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">people</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> where they are, since they’ve gone through lockdowns, travel restrictions, and remote working conditions that regularly overmatch the expectations set forth by traditional solutions for communication, collaboration, and virtual presence. We understood that we needed to accommodate these concerns before. What we didn’t expect was how central these matters would become to the goal of retaining valuable talent and providing an engaging place to work. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Enter Microsoft Teams. If you’ve read what I’ve posted here before you’ll know how much the platform has been able to offer, even before the pandemic, in terms of connecting your people to each other and the work that they do. What’s new is the way that Microsoft has seized the initiative to grow Teams (460 new innovations in 2022 alone) into an entire environment for people to feel each other’s presence, hear one another’s thoughts, and contribute meaningfully their ability to get things done.  </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One of the key ways this has been and will continue to be accomplished is through a rethinking and restrategizing of how people get together and meet for the sake of accomplishing shared goals. Meetings are decidedly one of the traditionally less exciting things we have to do during our workday. During the pandemic, the default response has been to bring them online, allowing people to connect virtually in a setting superficially equal to, but in reality more imbalanced than, traditional physical spaces. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Instead of accepting this and delivering enhancements based on a poor baseline, Microsoft has invested in research and development to determine the “why” and address the root causes, to make meetings powered by Teams Rooms occur in fundamentally different ways and deliver transformational improvements. Features like intelligent cameras allow Teams Rooms systems to dynamically present a view of in-room participants that gives them an equal footing to those joining remotely, and for the benefit of remote participants, intelligent speaker systems can highlight who is speaking and even interpret where the viewer’s focus should be aligned so as to offer them the same share of attention as if they were physically in the same space. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">None of this will matter, however, should organizations fail to recognize that the time to consider adopting and implementing such systems is now. Less than 8% of the world’s 90 million conference rooms are yet to be video enabled, and they are therefore unable to run inclusive hybrid meetings in which all participants feel included and heard. The reasons for this are many, but often the problem is a lack of imagination for how to proactively invest in solutions that accommodate our new world, and more mundanely, a lack of know-how for the way in which it should be addressed. As Nicole puts it, “Hybrid is not easy.” </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">At Cloudforce, we do not wait for such imperatives to enforce themselves. Since 2019 we have been investing in cutting-edge hybrid meeting room systems powered by Microsoft Teams to enable our workforce to remain agile and flexible. For this reason, Cloudforce not only maintained an elite standard of work and a positive culture throughout the pandemic, but we also even grew our organization multiple times over and continue to provide a workplace that inspires and protects our most important asset: our people. We are nothing without our team, and so we’ve continued to address these challenges head on in our most recent office redesign, implementing four more Teams Rooms systems from Neat, equipped with the intelligent features mentioned above. This ensures that we will be bringing the very best of ourselves to every engagement and offering the most seamless presence for our people when they need to work and play together. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We consider our ability to enable and fuel hybrid work to be one of our core competencies across many of our areas of expertise, and we couldn’t honestly do that unless we had achieved it for ourselves internally. Please reach out to us via the links below to ask how we can do the same for you. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
